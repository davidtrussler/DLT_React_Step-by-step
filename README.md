# React step by Step

This is based on the official ReactJS Step by Step Guide to learning React, which is online [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).

## Step 1

Set up React locally
- Create a basic HTML page
- Add a DOM Container to the HTML
- Add the Script Tags
- Create a React Component
- Add JSX to the Project
  - Run ```npm install``` to install from package.json
  - Run ```npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod``` to start watcher
